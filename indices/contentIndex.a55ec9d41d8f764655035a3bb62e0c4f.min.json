{"/":{"title":"Welcome","content":"\nHi, this is my personal digital garden, where I keep my digital form of knowledge to be referenced by me in the future, along with anyone else who might be interested in the topics I cover. I found myself happy with this type of exposure because it keeps me motivated to never stop learning and exploring things, and also could bring value to people by sharing structured knowledge. The areas that I cover here are:\n\n- [[Computer Systems]] - my work and passion; it's the main focus of this project\n- [[Life Management]]- concepts, tools and hacks to manage life stuff, covering some topics such as productivity and personal finances\n- [[Learning]] - theories and techniques to learn anything faster and better\n- [[Miscellaneous]] - what doesn't fit in the above subjects\n\nEach section has its meaning, motivations and goals in mind, all explained in its root files (where all previous links points to). There will be a plenty of \"TBD\" (to be done) files, all marked with a ==\\*== for easier mapping. This TBD files and directories are there intentionally, because:\n\n- I already have familiarity (to a lesser or greater degree) in a considerable number of these topics, and so fulfilling then is just a matter of time\n- I want to explore in-depth all the topics and concepts covered in this project, seeding the garden with what I already know and what I'm learning. Maintaining the empty files and sections in the project helps me not forgetting about then and my ultimate goal\n- They remember me that there is a lot to learn in this life (analog to the [Antilibrary](https://fs.blog/the-antilibrary/) concept)\n\nIn this project knowledge is referenced both by its logical groups (the area it belongs). and its interrelations (internal linking between pages). Groups can be seen in the left panel as a tree of directories and files, and interrelations can be explored in the end of each file, in the ***Backlinks*** and ***Interactive Graph***.\n\nThe content presented here comes from different sources: my experience and thoughts on the topics, book reads and (mine) reviews, technical docs, blog articles, YouTube videos and so on, (hopefully) all properly referenced.\n\nIf you found any inaccuracy or knowledge gaps that in your opinion if filled would enrich this project, please reach me out at \u003cme@rooli.dev\u003e. Happy exploration ðŸ™ƒ","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T20:24:35.788625452Z","tags":null},"/Computer-Systems/":{"title":"","content":"[TBD]\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T20:24:35.788625452Z","tags":null},"/Computer-Systems/Design-Architecture/":{"title":"Design \u0026 Architecture *","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T20:24:35.788625452Z","tags":null},"/Computer-Systems/Design-Architecture/DDD/":{"title":"DDD *","content":"\n[TBD]","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T20:24:35.788625452Z","tags":null},"/Computer-Systems/Design-Architecture/Distributed-Systems/":{"title":"Distributed Systems *","content":"[TBD]\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T20:24:35.788625452Z","tags":null},"/Computer-Systems/Design-Architecture/Distributed-Systems/Patterns/":{"title":"","content":"[TBD]","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T20:24:35.788625452Z","tags":null},"/Computer-Systems/Design-Architecture/Distributed-Systems/Principles":{"title":"","content":"[TBD]","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T20:24:35.788625452Z","tags":null},"/Computer-Systems/Design-Architecture/SOLID":{"title":"SOLID *","content":"[TBD]\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T20:24:35.788625452Z","tags":null},"/Computer-Systems/DevOps/":{"title":"DevOps","content":"As stated in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps):\n\u003e **DevOps**Â is a methodology in the software development and IT industry.
